place flaccid and countdown somewhere in your PATH

I like to create $HOME/bin and add $HOME/bin to my path, then place fun
binaries in there

run flaccid to reset your starttime to the current time

countdown relies on the existence of the COLUMNS environment variable. This
environment variable is not exported to child processes, so you need to do
this yourself. Bash will do this for you if you place the following into
your PROMPT_COMMAND environment variable:

	PROMPT_COMMAND="export COLUMNS"

modify your PS1 to include $(countdown)
e.g.

	PS1='$(countdown)[\u@\h \w]\$ '
or
	PS1="\$(countdown)[\u@\h \w]\$ "


By default, countdown counts down to 8 hours, but countdown will take an
arbitrary integer and count down to that many hours instead

$ ./countdown -h
usage: countdown [-h] hours

positional arguments:
  hours
